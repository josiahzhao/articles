# 【ElasticSearch系列连载】6. ES集群原理简析

## 简介
## 从一个空集群开始-master node
只负责集群级别的任务：节点增减，索引增减
不涉及数据
每一个节点都知道每一个数据在哪个节点的，每个节点都可以承接搜索任务，将其转发到多个正确的节点，然后合并返回
ne node in the cluster is elected to be the master node, which is in charge of manag‐ ing cluster-wide changes like creating or deleting an index, or adding or removing a node from the cluster. The master node does not need to be involved in document- level changes or searches, which means that having just one master node will not become a bottleneck as traffic grows. Any node can become the master. Our example cluster has only one node, so it performs the master role.
As users, we can talk to any node in the cluster, including the master node. Every node knows where each document lives and can forward our request directly to the nodes that hold the data we are interested in. Whichever node we talk to manages the pro‐ cess of gathering the response from the node or nodes holding the data and returning the final response to the client. It is all managed transparently by Elasticsearch.
